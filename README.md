# Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to **Algorithm Visualizer**! This comprehensive platform combines multiple visualization tools to help you understand both recursive and sorting algorithms through interactive visual representations. Whether you're learning about recursive function calls or comparing different sorting methods, this platform provides an intuitive way to grasp these fundamental computer science concepts.

## Features

### Landing Page
- **Unified Interface**: A clean, modern landing page that provides easy access to both visualizers
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Simple navigation between different visualization tools
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes

### Recursion Visualizer
- **Multiple Recursive Algorithms**: Visualize common recursive algorithms including:
  - Fibonacci Series
  - Factorial Calculation
  - Power Function
  - Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
  - Binary Search
  - Array Sum
  - Tower of Hanoi
- **Tree Visualization**: Each recursive call is represented as a node in a tree structure
- **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Clear visualization of each recursive step

### Sorting Visualizer
- **Various Sorting Algorithms**: Interactive visualization of:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Selection Sort
- **Customizable Input**:
  - Generate random arrays
  - Input custom arrays
  - Adjust array size
- **Animation Controls**: 
  - Configurable animation speed
  - Real-time visualization

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: 
  - Tailwind CSS (Recursion Visualizer)
  - Custom CSS (Sorting Visualizer)
- **Logic**: Plain JavaScript for algorithm implementations
- **Visualization**: JavaScript for rendering trees and array animations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd algorithm-visualizer
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
